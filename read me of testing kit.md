TESTING KIT PROJECT-
In this project ,we can test some of the basic electronic components whether they are working or not .These are-
1.LCD
2.Encoder
3.Servo
4.Relay

First it checks whether the LCD is working or not and then displays it on the LCD itself.
Then it gives you the instructions how to use this testing kit.
If you want to test any component, then press reset button

How to check servo(0 to 180)?
starting angle = 0 degree, servo rotates as an angle increases by +10 upto 180 degrees and then comes back 
to starting angle = 90 degree ,again rotates as an angle increases by +10 upto 180 degrees and then comes
back to 180 degree,here servo rotates as an angle decreases by -10 upto 0.
If servo rotates like mentioned above,that means servo is working properly.

How to check encoder?
If no of ticks displays on the LCD , when we rotates its shaft, external interrupts fire whenever
rising edge will come.
That means that encoder is working .

How to check relay?
For this excite the coil by providing 12V to its terminals.If switching occurs between NO and NC terminals,
that means relay is working.
This is for 12V relay.If 6V relay , then excite the coil by providing 6V to its terminals.
